Created for Ludum Dare #38

Originally we had intended to use React, but ran into difficulty with the setup. Lesson learned, do a dry run of the setup before the competition next time.

We are experimenting with Redux a bit, and the rest is just plain old JS, CSS, and HTML. Artists we are not, and we've got limited experience doing web development from scratch, but we're having a great time with little game. We may come back and add React after the competition ends.

The game is hosted via GitHub Pages, so it should be updated to the newest version.
